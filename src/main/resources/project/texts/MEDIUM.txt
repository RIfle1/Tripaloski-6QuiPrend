The Npcs choose the card with the smallest difference between each of their card and every last card placed on each row.
The chosen card will be greater than the last card placed on the row.

They will choose the row with the least amount of heads when their card is too small to be placed on the board.

On Variant 2 and 3 they will choose a random card from the table.
