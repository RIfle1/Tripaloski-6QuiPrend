The Npcs choose the card with the smallest difference between each of their card and every last card placed on each row.
The chosen card will be greater than the last card placed on the row.

If the chosen card will be placed on a row which already has 5 cards on it, the Npc will choose the second-best card with the smallest difference the card has to be greater than the last card placed on the row.

If the Npc has no card greater than every last card placed on each row, they will choose the smallest card they have.

The Npcs will choose the row with the least amount of heads when their card is too small to be placed on the board.

On Variant 2 and 3 they will always try to choose a card with the highest number of heads.
