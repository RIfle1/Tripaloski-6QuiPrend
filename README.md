## Java Doc
You can view the description of each function in our project by running "index.html" in the javaDoc folder.

## Jar Runnable
If you want to run the game without and IDE, you can run the "run.bat" executable.

## Disclaimer
The JavaDoc was generated by IntelliJ. 
Apparently the JavaDoc for our project is much larger than the project itself.
Therefore, in the programming languages, HTML appears to be the most used language.
